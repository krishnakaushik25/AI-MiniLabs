## [1.0] - 28/12/2021
- First commit


## Why Build This? :thinking:
Face anti-spoofing systems has lately attracted increasing attention due to its important role in securing face recognition systems from fraudulent attacks. This project aims to provide a starting point in recognising real and fake faces based on a model that is trained with publicly available dataset


## Where to use? :hammer:
This Face Anti Spoofing detector can be used in many different systems that needs realtime facial recognition with facial landmarks. Potentially could be used in security systems, biometrics, attendence systems and etc.

Can be integrated with hardware systems for application in offices, schools, and public places for various use cases.

## Datasets and Library :green_book:

The model is trained using Tensorflow from publicly available datasets. Below listed are the data sources that the model is trained on:

CASIA: https://github.com/namtpham/casia2groundtruth

OULU: https://sites.google.com/site/oulunpudatabase/

Please obtain the necessary permissions before using the datasets as above.
