# 🔬 AI MiniLabs by Krishna

A curated collection of experimental AI mini-projects exploring the latest in large language models (LLMs), multimodal reasoning, reinforcement learning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These projects span real-world domains including finance, identity verification, voice interfaces, and document understanding.

> 💡 Inspired by the **Daily Dose of Data Science** newsletter—many of these explorations were sparked by their outstanding insights.

## 📁 Project Showcase

### 🔊Interactive-Knowledge-Agent
A Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhanced by a deterministic multi-step agent architecture—essentially, a brain modeled as a graph that dynamically plans, retrieves, verifies, and synthesizes based on user question
